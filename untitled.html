<h1>Untitled</h1>
<pre>
You can rest easy in your lover's arms
Knowing that you're under a blanket and they're tucked under blanket bombs
Severed of legs &amp; arms, dads &amp; moms
You set about seven or eight alarms
And think it's the worst sound in the world
Yet you've never heard the whistle of a missile
As it's about to kill your little girl
I spin on my heel, pivot, swirl
You don't want to feel and so you curl
Into a ball of duvets
Because everyone know it's the hardest
To get up on Tuesdays
