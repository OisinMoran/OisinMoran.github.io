<h1>About</h1>


<h2>Me</h2>
<p>
    Oisín Moran (UH-sheen MORE-uhn) [ʌʃin mɔræn]
    I will also accept anything vaguely similar

    At/working on? <a href="https://inscribe.ai/">Inscribe</a>

<h2>This site</h2>
<p>
    There are a few guiding principles for this site. 
    For one, I am aiming for content over form, but I <em>am</em> still aiming for some pretty nice form.<br>
    It is currently lacking both.
</p>

<p>
    A few more desiderata:
    <ul>
        <li>Quick (should have small pages, and work well even with a poor connection)</li>
        <li>Quiet (no pop-ups, no tracking)</li>
        <li>Responsive (should be usable on <em>almost</em> all screens)</li>
        <li>Legible (should be equally as navigable for the colourblind and older people as it is for me)</li>
    </ul>
    As such, if you have suggestions for improvements or notice anywhere the site is falling short—in these regards or otherwise—I would love to hear from you.
</p>

<p>
    Some ideas for attributes on posts:
    <ul>
        <li>Tinkering vs Academic</li>
        <li><a href="https://devonzuegel.com/post/epistemic-statuses-are-lazy-and-that-is-a-good-thing">Epistemic Status</a></li>
        <li>First uploaded, last modified dates. The stretch goal here is a better way to make updates, edits, and fix erratta in online writing. Think Git meets The New York Times' 1969 retraction of their 1920 claim that spaceflight is impossible.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>
    I believe everyone should have their own little corner of the web, and this is mine—I hope you enjoy it!
