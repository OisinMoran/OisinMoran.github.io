    <h1>Keyboard Real Estate</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever noticed how easy it is to end up on some sites? You basically just
      <em>think</em> about the site and *boom* it's right there! It's simultaneously cool and a bit
      worrying. But it's also interesting to think about as part of the process of coming up with a
      good name for a site. Can <em>your</em> site be one of those on speed-dial?
    </p>
    <p>
      What I'm talking about here are those routes from a new tab to a website, which only take two
      key presses—namely, one letter (or number) followed by <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. This is enabled by
      any sort of autocomplete in a browser's URL. I mainly still use Google Chrome so this post
      uses their "omnibox".
    </p>
    <p>
      When thinking of a name do you want to steer clear of highly contested keys, or out-compete
      another site for their coveted position? Can you pick your site's first letter [0] to gain a
      position on users' keyboards?
    </p>
    <p>
      Here are all the keys on my keyboard where the first suggestion in Google Chrome's omnibox is
      a website, so that hitting <kbd>LETTER</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd> will take me there.
    </p>
    <img src="kre.png" width="100%" />
    <br /><br />
    <p>
      Some initial notes:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The occupied keys seem to be skewed a bit to the left (probably due to those letters being more common). These get the added benefit that I can hit the letter with my left hand, then hit <kbd>ENTER</kbd> with my right for maximum speed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Facebook has probably the most coveted position here—the home key for the left hand.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some logos play nice and represent the actual letter (Etsy, Amazon, Facebook, Hover, and my own site), while others look a bit confusing (LinkedIn and Hacker News).
        </li>
        <li>
          There are two entries for xkcd! One for the mobile site and one for the desktop one. I really wish Randall would just make the main one work on mobile.
        </li>
        <li>
          The right home key is currently vacant prime real estate! This would be a lovely right index finger <kbd>J</kbd> then right pinky <kbd>ENTER</kbd>. If anyone has any suggestions of worthy tennants please let me know.
        </li>
        <li>
          7/26 letters are unoccupied, as are 9/10 digits (the only exception being <a href="https://www.3dsystems.com/">3dsystems.com</a>—a website I have only visited once. So there is plenty of room, and there are plenty of displaceable entries.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Another surprise was how many of these I wasn't even of. Here are all the keys where I am actually <em>aware</em> of the single letter shortcuts, so that the combination above is muscle memory and effectively one movement. For example, I would not (before writing
      this) have expected <kbd>E</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd> to take me to Etsy, so would only notice I
      could do that after <em>observing</em> the omnibox suggestions. For Hacker News however, I am
      well aware that pressing <kbd>N</kbd> + <kbd>ENTER</kbd> takes me right to the orange website
      and do so frequently. There are also probably some where—not expecting a single letter hit—I
      would just type a few of the word's letters straight away, e.g. "sla" for Slack.
    </p>

    <p>
      This feels a bit more familiar. I've definitely used all of these (though don't really use Facebook anymore) and the only one I have any regrets about is the one true hellsite on the internet—LinkedIn.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's the full list of all keys (excluding numbers that don't have an occupant, and punctuation—which I think would probably be very difficult if not impossible to place for depending on how the omnibox actually works), their current occupant on my keyboard, and how difficult it would be to displace them—0 being trivial, and 3 quite difficult.

    <p>
      In closing, it's <em>possibly</em> worth thinking about this when coming up with a name for a new project, as if you can secure a good key on your users' keyboards, they'll have a much easier time navigating to your site.
      </p>
      <p>
      It would be interesting to see analyses done across groups of people, and also fun to make a tool that would create the keyboard visualisations above automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      As a related aside: A similar idea—effectively just a new form of SEO—can also be applied to other things, like content for Netflix. If you can reduce the amount of work people have to do with a tiny remote on an alphabetically ordered keyboard, they will thank you. A fun metric to compute would be the number of clicks it would take for a given title to be the first to appear in the search results—which would take in the keyboard layout, and the catalog of content (and if you want to get really fancy, you could average over the different content catalogs present in all the geographies where your title will be the same).
      I expect a lot more Aaron- and aardvark-based content.
