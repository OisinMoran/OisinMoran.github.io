<h1>St. Darina</h1>
<p><i>A poem for my mother on Mother's Day</i></p>
<pre>
Through playschool, primary, secondary, college
You have always helped me to accumulate knowledge
From the days spent in libraries trying to take out Dorling Kinderslys
And never allowing the librarians to hinder me
To lulling me asleep from the chair by my bed
Through the Harry Potter series where you'd always read ahead

Always checking how I'm doing, how I'm faring
Vigilant that that windcheater gets a good wearing
Say it'll rain and it does which is better than Met Eireann

That is one of your mystical maternal powers
An unknown like when did slidy-bum bath-time transition to showers?
Or if to a great gardener I've been a good flower.

You raised children foolhardy enough to game your insurance system
Creating injuries for jelly, to make them better you'd kiss them
While anything bigger was met with a plastering
And you've a skill for finding lost things I can only dream of mastering

Sometimes the only way to appreciate all that you do
Is for me to be stranded alone for a day ... or two
Then I realise I cannot cook food
And the mechanism behind returned socks, it was you!

To the mother who married my father and mothered his daughter
Within, is forever an author
From editing 'zines to editing Ois√≠n's
Actions and speeches, redactions and breaches
Of conduct you've long looked
At my workings and works
Amused by my quirks
Watched all my runs, track and field, athletics
I must fully thank you for half my genetics.
For somewhere within all those Gs, As, Cs and Ts
Is the code from my mother monkey for her love of climbing trees

To my ex freelance social policy researcher
Wild was my nature and you were my nurture.
