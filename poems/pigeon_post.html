<h1>Pigeon Post</h1>
<p class="poem">
How many carrier pigeons to send you to me?<br>
And if we’re being pragmatic, for what kind of fee?<br>
<br>
I would lick all the envelopes<br>
But my tongue would not be able to sing your praises<br>
Death by a thousand papercuts<br>
In the hope of avoiding some greater malaises<br>
<br>
I’m unsure of how well the postal service would mishandle you<br>
But I’m certain the birds won’t, as they’ve got none nevermind two<br>
It’s no insult and I’m not mad or off my rocker<br>
To suggest that you wouldn’t fit in an Amazon locker<br>
<br>
I ran the numbers and it would take 800 pigeons, which may not be legal<br>
But we could also get it done with just 24 eagles<br>
<br>
