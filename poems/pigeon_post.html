<h1>Pigeon Post</h1>
<pre>
How many carrier pigeons to send you to me?
And if we're being pragmatic, for what kind of fee?

I would lick all the envelopes
But my tongue would not be able to sing your praises
Death by a thousand papercuts
In the hope of avoiding some greater malaises

I'm unsure of how well the postal service would mishandle you
But I'm certain the birds won't, as they've got none nevermind two
It's no insult and I'm not mad or off my rocker
To suggest that you wouldn't fit in an Amazon locker

I ran the numbers and it would take 800 pigeons, which may not be legal
But we could also get it done with just 24 eagles
