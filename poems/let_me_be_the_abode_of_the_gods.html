<h1>Let Me be the Abode of the Gods</h1>
<pre>
I want to take you to beautiful places
Because they are where you belong
I’m at ease when we’re in a museum together
But can’t keep you in there for long

Their two feet away, no touching restrictions,
No flash-photography self-contradictions
Are moot, for you burn brighter than any Xenon tube
Yet they let you in and I can’t keep my hands off you

Pavements crack and trees topple as they crane their necks to see
Distracted birds smash into café windows, splashing down in cups of tea
“I thought my wings were well built for flight”
“I thought I was good at converting sunlight”

Two of them quip as passers-by trip
But my is she dazzling and by god she soars
If Helen could launch a thousand ships
She could staunch a thousand wars

</pre>
