<h1>Let Me be the Abode of the Gods</h1>
<p class="poem">
I want to take you to beautiful places<br>
Because they are where you belong<br>
I’m at ease when we’re in a museum together<br>
But can’t keep you in there for long<br>
<br>
Their two feet away, no touching restrictions,<br>
No flash-photography self-contradictions<br>
Are moot, for you burn brighter than any Xenon tube<br>
Yet they let you in and I can’t keep my hands off you<br>
<br>
Pavements crack and trees topple as they crane their necks to see<br>
Distracted birds smash into café windows, splashing down in cups of tea<br>
“I thought my wings were well built for flight”<br>
“I thought I was good at converting sunlight”<br>
<br>
Two of them quip as passers-by trip<br>
But my is she dazzling and by god she soars<br>
If Helen could launch a thousand ships<br>
She could staunch a thousand wars<br>
<br>
