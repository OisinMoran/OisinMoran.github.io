<h1>Proof You Are Crazy</h1>
<pre>
I could warn, as they do, to not lose your composure
But from the evidence it seems true that you have never found it
As if you did – even just for a second become, if you will, composed
Then all living things would rightfully turn up their nose at Bach, Chopin &amp; Lizst
And so, therefore, QED – your composure mustn't exist ▪
