<h1>Thirst</h1>
<pre>
Building and building upon the extant thirst
Walking through the drink aisles and past the fridges
Self-restraint arresting a potential to taint the first gulp
Because pre climax everything here looks heaven-sent
Drowning in one would be a life well spent
The fridge is the evident winner, its low hum and bright light drawing me like a moth
Condensation creeps down cool cans, vibrant designs face outwards

Outbound on a train, sitting on the Slovenian sun
Reading the drinks menu for some ghost-trolley that will never come
Surprised this menu hasn't burst into flames already
Lips solidified and set like air-dried clay
Sleep doesn't arrive, for me anyway

Back in Berlin, back of the queue
Of course I'm lagging behind the other two
Pay for this cylinder of relief
The satisfying clunk of opening it holds nothing 
Against the pure essence of quenching that flows through me

Halfway into the can though and I'm not really thirsty anymore.
