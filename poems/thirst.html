<h1>Thirst</h1>
<p class="poem">
Building and building upon the extant thirst<br>
Walking through the drink aisles and past the fridges<br>
Self-restraint arresting a potential to taint the first gulp<br>
Because pre climax everything here looks heaven-sent<br>
Drowning in one would be a life well spent<br>
The fridge is the evident winner, its low hum and bright light drawing me like a moth<br>
Condensation creeps down cool cans, vibrant designs face outwards<br>
<br>
Outbound on a train, sitting on the Slovenian sun<br>
Reading the drinks menu for some ghost-trolley that will never come<br>
Surprised this menu hasn’t burst into flames already<br>
Lips solidified and set like air-dried clay<br>
Sleep doesn’t arrive, for me anyway<br>
<br>
Back in Berlin, back of the queue<br>
Of course I’m lagging behind the other two<br>
Pay for this cylinder of relief<br>
The satisfying clunk of opening it holds nothing <br>
Against the pure essence of quenching that flows through me<br>
<br>
Halfway into the can though and I’m not really thirsty anymore.<br>
<br>
