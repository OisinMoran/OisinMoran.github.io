<h1>The Strangest Invasion</h1>
<p class="poem">
Their shape-shifting ships patrol the skies<br>
Often sending scouts down the mountains to spy<br>
Some hide inside trees creeping up to the leaves<br>
Others ride on the breeze and into cracks squeeze<br>
<br>
Despite their slippery skin they have failed to elude us <br>
And in most places we have rituals to boil these intruders<br>
Yes! Despite their slick membranes we have managed to catch them <br>
And torturing these creatures has become quite the fashion<br>
<br>
I hear you cry “What about love, compassion?”<br>
And to that I say “It’s revenge for a thrasin’!”<br>
<br>
They’ve killed many a man for no good reason<br>
And cordon off the roads in the wintry season.<br>
They are mean, they are evil, they’re in league with the shark<br>
And they block out the sun and make it all dark<br>
<br>
Their troops can be found on the beaches like D-day<br>
Or inside your very own sink, bath or bidet<br>
But don’t be alarmed by these ominous creatures<br>
For I have failed to mention any of their positive features<br>
<br>
They had a hand in the process of our evolution<br>
You could even say that they were the solution<br>
For if this race left they would be missed<br>
By nobody at all because we wouldn’t exist<br>
<br>
I cannot be certain of their political priorities<br>
But they represent in our government with a seventy percent majority<br>
I do know for sure that their goal isn’t to slaughter<br>
After all, why would it be? I’ve just been talking about water!<br>
