<h1>I Will Let You Down</h1>
<pre>
I will let you down
  from counter-tops &amp; bookshelves, much too tall for ourselves
I will let you down
  from trees climbed, rubbing your hands clean of some mossy slime
I will let you down
  from the attic with photographs, holding back embarrassed laughs
I will let you down
  stairs to blow out candles, as we grow old enough to consider socks and sandals
