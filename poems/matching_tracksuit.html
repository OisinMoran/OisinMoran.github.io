<h1>Matching Tracksuit</h1>
<pre>
He gets out of the car, daughter in tow
Wearing a matching tracksuit, from head to toe
They’re here to feed the swans stale bread
The father’s kitted out, covered up in pale lead

On the phone to one of his mates
Fervently describing where this voice can locate
In the father’s house, some hidden treasure
Which I assumed could only be for illicit pleasure

He says “Should be on the chair at the end of the kitchen table”
I cannot bear this anymore I am just not able
Don’t talk about this shit in front of your daughter
If you wanted to do business you shouldn’t have brought her

My angered thoughts are rudely interjected 
By exactly the opposite of what I expected
“I’d say you’ll like it, it’s pretty good stuff.
In fact I’d go as far as to say it’s my favourite book!”
