<h1>Matching Tracksuit</h1>
<p class="poem">
He gets out of the car, daughter in tow<br>
Wearing a matching tracksuit, from head to toe<br>
They’re here to feed the swans stale bread<br>
The father’s kitted out, covered up in pale lead<br>
<br>
On the phone to one of his mates<br>
Fervently describing where this voice can locate<br>
In the father’s house, some hidden treasure<br>
Which I assumed could only be for illicit pleasure<br>
<br>
He says “Should be on the chair at the end of the kitchen table”<br>
I cannot bear this anymore I am just not able<br>
Don’t talk about this shit in front of your daughter<br>
If you wanted to do business you shouldn’t have brought her<br>
<br>
My angered thoughts are rudely interjected <br>
By exactly the opposite of what I expected<br>
“I’d say you’ll like it, it’s pretty good stuff.<br>
In fact I’d go as far as to say it’s my favourite book!”<br>
<br>
