<h1>Good Toes</h1>
<pre>
You look like you've breathed deep
The smell of wooden floors in a ballet hall
Whose brethren took the mighty fall
For a book waning poetic on some aspect of life
Whose ancestors once mighty tall
Were washed into the sea and
Were placed on your fireplace as trophy driftwood
By your father who collects you
On rainy days and carves out
A trail in the falling droplets
While the streetlights pan across
Your face drifting to sleep in the back

</pre>
<p><i>2016</i></p>
