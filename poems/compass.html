<h1>Compass</h1>
<pre>
They told me that just because two words look similar doesn't mean that they will rhyme
I told them they didn't know what they were talking about, I do this all the time
I know my way around poetry I don't need a motherfucking compass
I know my way around you too and my god dat ass
