<h1>St. Darina</h1>
<p><i>A poem for my mother on Mother's Day</i></p>
<p class="poem">
Through playschool, primary, secondary, college<br>
You have always helped me to accumulate knowledge<br>
From the days spent in libraries trying to take out Dorling Kinderslys<br>
And never allowing the librarians to hinder me<br>
To lulling me asleep from the chair by my bed<br>
Through the Harry Potter series where you’d always read ahead<br>
<br>
Always checking how I’m doing, how I’m faring<br>
Vigilant that that windcheater gets a good wearing<br>
Say it’ll rain and it does—which is better than Met Eireann<br>
<br>
That is one of your mystical maternal powers<br>
An unknown like when did slidy-bum bath-time transition to showers?<br>
Or if to a great gardener I’ve been a good flower.<br>
<br>
You raised children foolhardy enough to game your insurance system<br>
Creating injuries for jelly, to make them better you’d kiss them<br>
While anything bigger was met with a plastering<br>
And you’ve a skill for finding lost things I can only dream of mastering<br>
<br>
Sometimes the only way to appreciate all that you do<br>
Is for me to be stranded alone for a day … or two<br>
Then I realise I cannot cook food<br>
And the mechanism behind returned socks, it was you!<br>
<br>
To the mother who married my father and mothered his daughter<br>
Within, is forever an author<br>
From editing ’zines to editing Oisín’s<br>
Actions and speeches, redactions and breaches<br>
Of conduct you’ve long looked<br>
At my workings and works<br>
Amused by my quirks<br>
Watched all my runs, track and field, athletics<br>
I must fully thank you for half my genetics.<br>
For somewhere within all those G’s, A’s, C’s and T’s<br>
Is the code from my mother monkey for her love of climbing trees<br>
<br>
To my ex-freelance social policy researcher<br>
Wild was my nature and you were my nurture.<br>
<br>
