<h1>Odysseus Revisited</h1>
<p class="poem">
“Tie me to the mast, my sailors<br>
Knot the ropes steadfast, my jailors<br>
For one cannot be admiring for long—<br>
without going crazy—the sirens’ song<br>
And I <em>need</em> to hear it before I die<br>
Without doing so in the process, so let’s give this a try<br>
Now, we’ve got a contract, we’ve got a pact<br>
Don’t release me however I act<br>
I’ll scream and I’ll shout, I’ll curse to the max<br>
But you won’t hear a thing, your ears filled up with wax<br>
Just sail straight ahead and pay me no heed<br>
Don’t loose me one bit ’til we’ve finished this deed”<br>
<br>
After a time on the sea, stirred within him strong emotion<br>
Sweet sounds, from green fields, lilting across the ocean<br>
Odysseus saw beautiful women, singing him songs of glory<br>
The oarsmen brave enough to look, had never seen creatures so gory<br>
He writhed and wriggled, with struggle and strain<br>
But they’d agreed not to release him, no matter his pain<br>
He now existed only to get closer to those voices<br>
And cursed that he had stripped himself of all desirable choices<br>
As he yearned and yearned for their gilded locks,<br>
The men rowed on, avoiding this barren land’s rocks<br>
Just a little ways to go ’til they could say they’d bested these beasts mythical<br>
As they made their uneventful way back home, to Ithaca<br>
<br>
Not before long, they again had reached land<br>
By golly, by gosh, it worked just as planned!<br>
They emptied their lobes<br>
And untied his ropes<br>
And the townspeople came down to celebrate in the port<br>
And everyone had a good aul’ cavort<br>
For years and years they said it couldn’t be done<br>
But this genius team had surely just won<br>
In the celebration and uproar, they cracked open a cask<br>
As one of the oarsmen turned to Odysseus to ask<br>
“What was the song like? How did they sound?”<br>
<br>
But he’d jumped off the harbour, tried to swim back and drowned.<br>
