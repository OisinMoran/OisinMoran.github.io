        Re: Proposal to erect clay &amp; wattle cabin at Innisfree
    </center>
</p>

<p>
Dear Sir,
</p>

<p>
Regarding the proposals outlined in your communication of the 4<sup>th</sup> inst., I am directed to draw your
attention to the following deficiencies in your specification:
</p>

<ul id="jim">
    <li>
        The proposed materials, clay and wattle, are unacceptable and moreover would not qualify
        for any building grants. Our Building Surveyor recommends, as a minimal standard,
        asbestos cement slates for the roof and 9" hollow block concrete walls.
    </li>

    <li>
        Your description “small cabin” does not give an exact indication of its exact size. Please
        submit dimensioned drawings (plan, cross-section and elevation to a scale of 1/40) and a
        location map with scale of 1/1250.
    </li>

    <li>
        In dealing with your proposal to have 9 (nine) bean rows the County Agricultural Officer
        will forward to you the Dept. of Agriculture leaflets relating to the cultivation of beans.
    </li>

    <li>
        Your proposal to have a hive for the honey bee has been referred to the Chief Horticultural
        Officer who has reported as follows:<br>
        <em>
            While I have no objection in principle to Mr Yeats's
            proposal to have a hive for the honey bee, I must point out that keeping only one honey bee
            does not appear to be an economic proposition. I would recommend that since he is
            incurring the capital cost of a hive, it would be better for him to install an average swarm (5
            or 6 lbs, i.e. 25,000 to 30,000 bees). This, in addition to being more practicable, would
            ensure that he would have an adequately bee-loud glade. One bee would make very little
            noise, and in any event would be liable to become very lonely if left on its own in the hive.
        </em>
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    I have no comment to make on the remainder of your specification, which appears to be somewhat
    superfluous, but your remarks regarding standing “on the roadway or the pavements grey” have
    been referred to the County Engineer. He generally advises the better alternative wherever a
    pavement (grey or otherwise) is available.
</p>

<p>
    Yours etc.,
</p>
