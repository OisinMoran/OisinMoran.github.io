<h1>Collector</h1>
<pre>
I want to collect every photon you have ever emitted
And hunt them all down throughout the galaxy

Equipped with my electromagnetic butterfly net,
Some mason jars, and my own silhouette
Out the window of my spaceboat, my feet on the controls
I'm swirling around the edge of black holes

As I catch the last one, just on the fringe of the event horizon
I now understand these jars were made to keep fireflies in
