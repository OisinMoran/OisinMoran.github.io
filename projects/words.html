<h1>Words that do not Exist but Should</h1>
<p>
    This idea, or more correctly this class of idea, came from two sources.
    One is Douglas Adams & John Lloyd’s book <em>The Meaning of Liff</em>—and the later expanded version <em>The Deeper Meaning of Liff</em>—which took underutilised place names and repurposed them into such wonderful definitions as “Moffat (n.) That part of a coat which is designed to be sat on by the person next to you on the bus.”.
<p>
    The other was a collection of so-called “untranslatable” words from other languages.
    For example, the Portuguese <em>saudade</em>—a deep emotional state of nostalgic or profound melancholic longing; 
    or the Yaghan <em>mamihlapinatapei</em>—the wordless, meaningful look shared by two people who both want to initiate something, but are reluctant to do so. 
</p>
<p>
    Adams himself may also have been inspired by these untranslatable words. In <em>Dirk Gently’s Holistic Detective Agency (1987)</em> there is a London restaurant called “L’Esprit d’Escalier”, which is a French term for thinking of the perfect comeback after the discussion is over.
</p>
<p>
    Here, rather than co-opting place names as Adams & Lloyd did, I have tried to come up with new words, some of which are not entirely unreasonable.
    This is a living document and I may at some point ask for your help in coming up with these new names, as in most cases the definition comes first.
