<h1>You</h1>
<p>
You are the energy that fills the room<br>
Your excited jumps quake the cracks of doom<br>
You are the effigy to all that makes me swoon<br>
With the whites of your eyes brighter than the surface of the moon<br>

<h1>Proof You Are Crazy</h1>
<pre>
I could warn, as they do, to not lose your composure
But from the evidence it seems true that you have never found it
As if you did – even just for a second become, if you will, composed
Then all living things would rightfully turn up their nose at Bach, Chopin &amp; Lizst
And so, therefore, QED – your composure mustn’t exist ▪

<h1>⠙⠁⠞⠀⠁⠎⠎</h1>
<pre>
I have suspended my reading list
And switched to braille
I want to read you from top to tail

(Typed and title added 14th July 2016, but finished on first conception much earlier)

<h1>Tangela</h1>
<pre>
Just knowing that you exist keeps me happy
And the blanket lets me know
When I pull it close and drift to sleep
A log fire when the world is snow

For sprinkled deep are quantum threads
Connecting entangled sheets on our beds	
And quantum entangled thoughts in our heads

<h1>Collector</h1>
<pre>
I want to collect every photon you have ever emitted
And hunt them all down throughout the galaxy

Equipped with my electromagnetic butterfly net,
Some mason jars, and my own silhouette
Out the window of my spaceboat, my feet on the controls
I’m swirling around the edge of black holes

As I catch the last one, just on the fringe of the event horizon
I now understand these jars were made to keep fireflies in

<h1>Pigeon Post</h1>
<pre>
Pigeon Post
How many carrier pigeons to send you to me?
And if we’re being pragmatic, for what kind of fee?

I would lick all the envelopes
But my tongue would not be able to sing your praises
Death by a thousand papercuts
In the hope of avoiding some greater malaises

I’m unsure of how well the postal service would mishandle you
But I’m certain the birds won’t, as they’ve got none nevermind two
It’s no insult and I’m not mad or off my rocker
To suggest that you wouldn’t fit in an Amazon locker

I ran the numbers and it would take 800 pigeons, which may not be legal
But we could also get it done with just 24 eagles

<h1>Let me be the abode of the gods</h1>
<pre>
I want to take you to beautiful places
Because they are where you belong
I’m at ease when we’re in a museum together
But can’t keep you in there for long

Their two feet away, no touching restrictions,
No flash-photography self-contradictions
Are moot, for you burn brighter than any Xenon tube
Yet they let you in and I can’t keep my hands off you

Pavements crack and trees topple as they crane their necks to see
Distracted birds smash into café windows, splashing down in cups of tea
I thought my wings were well built for flight
I thought I was good at converting sunlight

Two of them quip as passers-by trip
But my is she dazzling and by god she soars
If Helen could launch a thousand ships
She could staunch a thousand wars

<h1>Compass</h1>
<pre>
They told me that just because two words look similar doesn’t mean that they will rhyme
I told them they didn’t know what they were talking about, I do this all the time
I know my way around poetry I don’t need a motherfucking compass
I know my way around you too and my god dat ass

<h1>I Will Let You Down</h1>
<pre>
I will let you down
  from counter-tops &amp; bookshelves, much too tall for ourselves
I will let you down
  from trees climbed, rubbing your hands clean of some mossy slime
I will let you down
  from the attic with photographs, holding back embarrassed laughs
I will let you down
  stairs to blow out candles, as we grow old enough to consider socks and sandals
